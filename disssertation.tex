\prefacesection{Abstract}
Natural languages are ripe with regularities. Where do these regularities come from? A parsimonious explanation is that these regularities emerge as a consequence of pressures within the broader context in which language is used: Communication among many cognitive systems. In this dissertation, I consider one particular regularity as a case study in how the dynamics of language use might shape language structure. Specifically, I focus on a bias in natural language to map long words on to conceptually complex meanings and short words on to conceptually simple meanings, or a {\it complexity bias}. Across a series of experimental and corpus studies, I explore whether languages and their speakers have a complexity bias, what conceptual complexity is, and what pressures might have lead to this bias over the course of language evolution. In the final chapter, I consider a broader range of linguistic phenomenon and examine how aspects of language use might influence these structures. 

\prefacesection{Acknowledgments}
I feel incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity and support to study a question that I find so fascinating for five years. On a short timescale, I thank the day-to-day cheer and camaraderie of the developmental community, my labmates, and my friends Kyla and Caitlin. On a longer timescale, I thank my advisor, Mike, for his intellectual guidance, but also his patience and kindness. On an even longer timescale, I thank my parents, Bonnie and Marshall, for their unconditional support of me and my pursuits. Finally, gratitude to my partner, Dan, for love and encouragement in an innumerable number of ways. This dissertation, I can say with certainty, is the product of (supportive) pressures at all of these timescales.
